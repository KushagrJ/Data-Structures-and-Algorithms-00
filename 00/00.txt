/* Trivia - 00

 * A data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate
   access and modifications.
 * Using the appropriate data structure(s) is an important part of algorithm
   design.

 * In the context of computer science and mathematics, in almost all cases, an
   algorithm is a well-defined computational procedure that takes some input and
   produces some output for a well-defined computational problem in a finite
   amount of time.
 * More generally, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined steps to be
   followed in order to accomplish a given task.
