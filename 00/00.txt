 * A data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate
   access and modifications.
 * Using the appropriate data structure(s) is an important part of algorithm
   design.

 * There is a difference between a data type and a data structure.
   In the context of C, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/29973810.

 * An abstract data type (ADT) is simply the description of a data type /
   data structure.
   But, once that data type / data structure has been implemented in a language,
   it no longer remains an ADT, and rather becomes concrete.
   So, for eg., the idea of an integer data type is an ADT, but the data type
   int is not an ADT and is rather a fundamental/primitive data type.
   Similarly, the idea of a sequential data structure is an ADT, but the data
   structures array and linked list are not ADTs.
 * So, the definition of an ADT which says that an ADT is a data type /
   data structure whose implementation details are hidden from the user
   (i.e the user of that data type / data structure) is not fully correct.
 * Simply put, a formal abstract description of a data type's / data structrue's
   properties and of the operations that can be performed on the it is called an
   abstract data type.
   This description shouldn't be tied to any particular implementation or
   programming language.

 * In the context of computer science and mathematics, in almost all cases, an
   algorithm is a well-defined computational procedure that takes some input and
   produces some output for a well-defined computational problem in a finite
   amount of time.
 * More generally, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined steps to be
   followed in order to accomplish a given task.

 * An instance of a problem consists of the input (satisfying whatever
   constraints are imposed in the problem statement) needed to compute a
   solution to the problem.

 * An algorithm for a computational problem is correct if, for every problem
   instance provided as input, it halts, i.e. finishes its computing in finite
   time, and outputs the correct solution to the problem instance.
 * A correct algorithm solves the given computational problem.
 * An incorrect algorithm might not halt at all on some input instances, or it
   might halt with an incorrect answer.


 * The sorting problem :-

   Input: A sequence of n numbers a1, a2, ... , an.

   Output: A permutation (reordering) a1', a2', ... , an' of the input sequence
   such that a1' <= a2' <= ... <= an'.

 * Because many programs use it as an intermediate step, sorting is a
   fundamental operation in computer science.
   As a result, there are a large number of good sorting algorithms available.
 * Which sorting algorithm is the best for a given application depends on the
   number of items to be sorted, the extent to which the items are already
   somewhat sorted, possible restrictions on the item values, etc.
